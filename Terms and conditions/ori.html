color:black;mso-color-alt:windowtext'>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY
        BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND HELIXVM TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH
        BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK
        RELIEF FROM HELIXVM.<br>
        <br>
        Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or
        proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") in which either party seeks to bring an
        individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable
        relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including,
        without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets
        or patents, YOU AND HELIXVM AGREE (A) TO WAIVE YOUR AND HELIXVM'S RESPECTIVE
        RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, OR
        THE SERVICES, RESOLVED IN A COURT, AND (B) TO WAIVE YOUR AND HELIXVM'S
        RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. Instead, you and <span class=SpellE>HelixVM</span>
        agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral
        of a dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the dispute and
        making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the
        dispute decided by a judge or jury in court) conducted by the American
        Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the arbitration rules in effect at the
        time the arbitration is initiated (the "AAA Rules") and under the rules set
        forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the
        rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.<br>
        <br>
        Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in Palm
        Beach County, Florida. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing,
        administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with the AAA Rules. The award
        rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable
        attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment
        on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
        competent jurisdiction. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY
        TRIAL. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT
        TO A TRIAL.<br>
        <br>
        You and <span class=SpellE>HelixVM</span> agree that these Terms affect
        interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 14 shall be
        both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in
        accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA"),
        to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.<br>
        <br>
        YOU AND HELIXVM EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
        WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY DISPUTES ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A
        REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.<br>
        <br>
        YOU AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY DISPUTE
        ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN
        ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE, OR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE
        FOREVER BARRED.<br>
        <br>
        These Terms, and your access to and use of the Services shall be governed by
        and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas,
        without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of
        Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws
        of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties that is not subject
        to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved on
        an individual basis in the state or federal courts of the State of Texas and
        the United States, respectively, sitting in Travis County, Texas.<br>
        <br>
        All parts of these Terms of Use apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. <span class=SpellE>HelixVM</span>
        and you both agree that if we cannot enforce a part
        of this contract as written, then that part will be replaced with terms that
        most closely match the intent of the part we cannot enforce, to the extent
        permitted by law. The invalidity of part of these Terms of Use will not affect
        the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The section
